            in their collegiate studies. Writing competency is an ongoing process to be reinforced through
            writing-intensive courses and writing across the curriculum. Speaking and listening skills need
            reinforcement through multiple opportunities for interpersonal communication, public speaking,
            and discussion.</p>

        <h3><u>Goal 2: Critical Thinking</u></h3>
        <p>To develop thinkers who are able to unify factual, creative, rational, and value-sensitive modes of thought.
            Critical thinking will be taught and used throughout the general education curriculum in order to develop
            students' awareness of their own thinking and problem-solving procedures. To integrate new skills into

        <p>To improve students' understanding of natural science principles and of the methods of scientific inquiry,
            i.e., the ways in which scientists investigate natural science phenomena. As a basis for lifelong learning,
            students need to know the vocabulary of science and to realize that while a set of principles has been
            developed through the work of previous scientists, ongoing scientific inquiry and new knowledge will bring
            changes in some of the ways scientists view the world. By studying the problems that engage today's
            scientists, students learn to appreciate the importance of science in their lives and to understand the
            value of a scientific perspective. Students should be encouraged to study both the biological and physical
            sciences.</p>

        <p>To increase students' knowledge about mathematical and logical modes of thinking. This will enable students
            to appreciate the breadth of applications of mathematics, evaluate arguments, and detect fallacious
            reasoning. Students will learn to apply mathematics, logic, and/or statistics to help them make decisions
            in their lives and careers. Minnesota's public higher education systems have agreed that developmental
            mathematics includes the first three years of a high school mathematics sequence through intermediate algebra.</p>

            and develop an appreciation of the arts and humanities as fundamental to the health and survival of any
